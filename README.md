My Python Portfolio - examples of my work

* **_boilerplate_1.5.py** - my starting point for non-trivial scripts.  It contains capabilities I use often, such as 
    * documentation
    * library imports
    * environment settings
    * coordinate system references
    * extension checkout
    * logging to the screen and a CSV
    * counting rows
    * generic exception handling

  The header is embedded documentation.  This has been borrowed from my Java lecturer when I was at uni.  It makes for useful, self-describing scripts. Key sections are:
  * The usual description, author, date and version
  * Pre - means preconditions, what needs to be true for the code to work
  * Param - parameters that are expected to be passed in
  * Return - values/objects that are returned
  * Post-post conditions. Things that are true when the program finishes
  * Issues and limitations 
  * My personal naming conventions for files and parts of file names
